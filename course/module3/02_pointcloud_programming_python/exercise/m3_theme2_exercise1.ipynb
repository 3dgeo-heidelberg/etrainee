    "# Exercise: Virtual Laser Scanning in HELIOS++ for Point Cloud Change Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "In this excercise we will be conducting an experiment of surface change analysis using UAV-borne laser scanning (ULS) point clouds and virtually generated airborne laser scanning (ALS) point coulds. Our area of interest (AOI) is a rock glacier in Austria of which UAV point clouds have been acquired repeatedly by the [3DGeo Research Group](https://www.geog.uni-heidelberg.de/3dgeo/index.html) in Heidelberg over the past years. By analysing and comparing the point clouds from different points in time (epochs), it is possible to analyse the movement of the rock glacier.\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of this exercise is to analyse the difference in surface change detection when acquiring the rock glacier using ULS vs ALS. ALS point clouds generally have lower point densities and therefore lower spatial resolutions as well as lower overall ranging accuracy and may therefore lead to unwanted noise in the change detection. However, ALS can prove to be a more cost-efficient method due to the large coverage areas. For many regions, ALS datasets are available online via national inventory databases. Therefore the option of using ALS data may be considered if the acquired data meets the requirements for any given analysis. Virtual laser scanning (VLS) is a valuable tool that can help us determine whether point clouds from certain LiDAR acquisitions meet the analysis requirements. In this case, we will be analysing whether ALS point clouds of the rock glacier in Austria would deliver valuable results when applying a rudimentary method of surface change analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do so, we will first perform surface change detection between our two epochs of ULS data. Then, we will generate ALS data for each epoch, using the Heidelberg LiDAR Operations Simulator (HELIOS++) and the ULS data as the 3D models which are recorded by the virtual airborne laser scanner. After performing surface change analysis on the ALS data for each epoch, we can compare the results of the ULS and the ALS surface change analysis and determine if there is a noteworthy difference in the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note to start:** HELIOS++ must be installed on your device for this exercise. You can download HELIOS++ from the [HELIOS++ GitHub repo](https://github.com/3dgeo-heidelberg/helios). Additionally, to enable hidden solution cells, you must install the jupyter notebook extension [Exercise](https://jupyter-contrib-nbextensions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/nbextensions/exercise/readme.html). Instructions to install jupyter extensions can be found [here](https://jupyter-contrib-nbextensions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html).\n",

    "The data for the exercise is located in the directory `ahk` of the course data repository."

    "We found that the lower density point clouds from ALS deliver a similar amount of information on the areas of surface change but yielded inaccuracies regarding the magnitude of the surface changes. Thus we  can conclude that, to apply this approach in future, point clouds with lower point densities as delivered by ALS acquisitions of the rock glacier would be sufficient to detect the areas where surface change occurred, whereas the ULS data with a higher spatial resoution would be required to accurately measure the magnitude of the change. Since ALS acquisitions can cover large areas relative to ULS, this could prove to be a more cost-efficient acquisition method when monitoring areas of surface change, especially since ALS datasets are often available online via national inventory databases.\n",
