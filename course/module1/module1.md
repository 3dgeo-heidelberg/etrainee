# Methods of Time Series Analysis in Remote Sensing

Module 1 covers a range of basic principles and methods of remote sensing time series analysis that are applicable to data from different platforms and sensors. While the hands-on parts of the module focus on optical satellite imagery, many of the approaches you learn here will be helpful for working with other data types (such as close-range imagery time series or time series of 3D point clouds from photogrammetry or laser scanning). Hence, in this module you will learn about:

* Principles of time series in general and remote sensing time series in specific
* Major Earth observation missions, data archives and access options
* Strategies and computing facilities for large remote sensing time series, including introductions with Python and with the Google Earth Engine
* Classification approaches and methods for remote sensing time series
* Trajectory-based views on remotely sensed variables
* Approaches to land surface monitoring and change detection
* Fusion of multi-modal remote sensing time series
* Possibilities and best practices for validating your analyses with remote sensing time series

## Prerequisites to perform this module

The following skills and background knowledge are required for this module:

* Basics of statistics
* Basics of geoinformation systems and handling raster/vector data
* Some familiarity with QGIS
* Basic programming skills in Python
* Principles of remote sensing


## Software

For the practical parts of this module (excercises and tutorials), you will need:

* [QGIS](../software/software_qgis.md) - In some of the Module 1 excercises, the graphical user interface of QGIS is used for visualization of data or for digitizing polygons (used to label training samples).
* [Google Earth Engine](https://earthengine.google.com/) - For several tutorials and excercises of Module 1, a registered user account for this service is required (create one [here](https://earthengine.google.com/signup/), if you don't have one).
* [Python](../software/software_python.md) - You can use the package and environment management system [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) and the `etrainee_m1.yml` file to install the packages needed for the tutorials and excercises into a fresh Python environment. The yaml file can be downloaded here: <a href=../assets/python_envs/etrainee_m1.yml download>etrainee_m1.yml</a>.


## Toolbox intro

Before you start with [Theme 1](./01_principles_of_remote_sensing_time_series/01_principles_of_remote_sensing_time_series.md) of Module 1, we recommend that you go through the **[Toolbox intro](./toolbox_intro/ETRAINEE_intro_overview.md)**. There, you will learn how to

* set up your working environment with **Python** and all required packages
* create, modify and run interactive **Jupyter Notebooks** containing Python code
* use Python for basic processing steps and visualization of **geospatial data**


## Practical parts of this module (overview)

Module 1 contains at least one practical part (tutorial or excercise) per theme. The tutorials are linked as separate documents in the respective sections of a theme. Many of them are provided as Python Jupyter Notebooks and, if you download them, you can explore them interactively.

### Mandatory parts

It is recommended to go through the following tutorials and excercises (one per theme). They are focusing on image time series analysis with Python's `xarray` package and the Google Earth Engine (GEE) Python API, and they (partly) build upon each other:

* Theme 1
    * Tutorial 1: [Raster Time Series in Python using xarray](./01_principles_of_remote_sensing_time_series/T1_S2_xarray.ipynb), introducing the xarray package for handling labelled, multi-dimensional arrays at the example of a Sentinel-2 satellite image time series.
* Theme 2
    * Tutorial 1: [Sentinel-2 via STAC in Python](./02_large_time_series_datasets_in_remote_sensing/T2_Sentinel_STAC_v03.ipynb), showing how to access Sentinel-2 data via a SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog (STAC) and get it into the Python xarray processing framework.
* Theme 3
    * Tutorial 1: [Image time series classification in Python](./03_time_series_analysis_based_on_classification/T3_S2_landcover_classification.ipynb), showing a machine learning workflow with spectral-temporal metrics (derived from one season of satellite imagery) as features for landcover classification. The result is one landcover map (which we will validate in theme 6).
* Theme 4
    * Tutorial: [Forest disturbance assessment with Python and the GEE](./04_trajectory-based_analysis/T4_GEE_NDVI_time_series_points.ipynb), examining a Landsat 8 NDVI time series (spectral-temporal trajectory) to assess the timing of forest disturbance.
* Theme 5
    * Tutorial: [Sentinel-1/-2 surface water monitoring](./05_spatio_temporal_data_fusion/T5_water_surface_data_fusion.ipynb), where you learn how to combine Sentinel-1 SAR data and Sentinel-2 optical imagery for monitoring the extent of a water reservoir in a relatively simple workflow.
* Theme 6
    * Exercise: [Assessment of landcover classification accuracy](./06_reference_data_validation_accuracy_assessment/06_reference_data_validation_accuracy_assessment.md#exercise-assessment-of-landcover-classification-accuracy), with a solution provided in [this Notebook](./06_reference_data_validation_accuracy_assessment/T6_S2_landcover_classification_accuracy_solution.ipynb).

### Optional parts

In case you want to explore further topics and methods, there are more tutorials and excercises available:

* Theme 1
    * Tutorial 2: [Exploring a Sentinel-2 time series using QGIS and the GEE Timeseries Explorer plugin](./01_principles_of_remote_sensing_time_series/T1_QGIS_GEE_TS_Explorer.md)
    * Tutorial 3: [Explore temporal profiles of a vegetation index in Python with pandas](./01_principles_of_remote_sensing_time_series/T1_spectral-temporal_profiles.md)
    * Tutorial 4: [Exploring and processing a Sentinel-2 time series using the GRASS GIS temporal framework](./01_principles_of_remote_sensing_time_series/T1_GRASS_raster_time_series.md)
* Theme 2
    * Tutorial 2: [Google Earth Engine (GEE) in Python](./02_large_time_series_datasets_in_remote_sensing/T2_GEE_s2cloudless_v03_export_time_series.ipynb), showing how to use the GEE cloud computing environment and its Python API for accessing, cloud-masking and downloading a Sentinel-2 time series.
    * Tutorial 3: [Large point clouds in Python](./02_large_time_series_datasets_in_remote_sensing/PC_explore_v02.ipynb), providing a couple of hints for handling and exploring large point clouds efficiently in Python (so far not time-series specific).
    * Excercise: [Search and load Landsat data to QGIS via a STAC API](./02_large_time_series_datasets_in_remote_sensing/02_large_time_series_datasets_in_remote_sensing.md#excercise)
* Theme 3
    * Tutorial 2 with excercise:
        * The [Snow cover time series in Python tutorial](./03_time_series_analysis_based_on_classification/T3_S2_snow_classification.ipynb), introduces a very basic procedure for (binary) snow cover mapping with a Sentinel-2 time series. The result is a time series of snow cover maps.
        * Excercise: Based on the tutorial, try to interpret the spatial patterns of snow cover duration and investigate the sensitivity of the rule-based classification regarding the classification threshold. For a suggested solution to this excercise see the Notebook [Snow cover time series: Interpretation and sensitivity analysis](./03_time_series_analysis_based_on_classification/T3_S2_snow_classification__excercise.ipynb).
