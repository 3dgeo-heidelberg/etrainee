Welcome to the course on "**Time Series Analysis in Remote Sensing for Understanding Human-Environment Interactions**".

The **main objective** is to learn new tools and methods for time series analysis of remote sensing data and to understand their fit-for-purpose application in Geography and environmental sciences. 

The course consists of **X selected modules of a larger e-learning course** called [E-TRAINEE]([https://web.natur.cuni.cz/gis/etrainee/](https://web.natur.cuni.cz/gis/etrainee/)) that is jointly developed by the Universities of Prague, Warsaw, Innsbruck and Heidelberg in the framework of Erasmus+ and 4EU+ (see [https://web.natur.cuni.cz/gis/etrainee/](https://web.natur.cuni.cz/gis/etrainee/)):

* Module 1: Methods of Time Series Analysis in Remote Sensing
* Module 2: Satellite Multispectral Images Time Series Analysis
* Module 3: 3D/4D Geographic Point Cloud Time Series Analysis
* Module 4: Airborne Imaging and Laboratory Spectroscopy Time Series Analysis

* This website is automatically generated from the corresponding **Github repository**: [xxx](add link). The repository is linked at the top right of the website on all pages. 
* Some parts of the course are conducted in **Jupyter Notebooks**. These are static pages on the website, but it is recommended that you follow them interactively. Use the **download button** at the top of the respective pages. This will open the raw file in your browser, just right click and use "Save page as / Seite speichern unter..." to store the ipynb file.
* All **data** required for the course is contained in the [central data repository](#data-repository). Each theme contains information which of the data (directories) is relevant for the current task.
    * You can **report issues** via the [Issue Tracker](add link) on the Github repository. Depending on the type of issue, they will be solved throughout the course or considered in future development.
