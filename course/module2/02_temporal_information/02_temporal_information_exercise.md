Temporal information in satellite data - Exercise
================

## Exercise - Change Moments and Agents in Tatra Mountains

In this exercise you will be able to complete a few tasks: identifying **moments of changes** visible in the imagery as well as attributing **change agents** to detected moments based on trajectories of selected spectral indices.

The main objective of this exercise is not only to show you some examples of changes and change agents, but also to provide you with the ability to prepare your own reference data sets for different purposes on the basis of photointerpretation of imagery chips and charts presenting relationships of spectral indices values and changes happening on the ground.


**UNDER CONSTRUCTION. COMING SOON**
