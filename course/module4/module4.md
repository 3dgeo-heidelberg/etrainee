# Airborne Imaging Spectroscopy Time Series Analysis 

Imaging spectroscopy enables detailed studies of land surface based on its optical properties
acquired in many, usually a few hundred, narrow spectral bands. Resulting hyperspectral imagery
collected over a selected area and time span can be used, e.g., for studying the responses of vegetation to
climate change or other environmental disturbances caused by human activities. In situ and
laboratory spectroscopy provide point-based measurements of selected samples, and they are useful
for the derivation and assessment of theoretical concepts and for calibration and validation
measurements from airborne or satellite sensors. In this module, you will learn about:

* retrieval of land surface properties from spectroscopic measurements
* relating optical properties of vegetation/leaves to their biophysical and biochemical parameters
* acquisition of airborne and RPAS hyperspectral imagery and its radiometric and geometric pre-processing
* machine learning classification applied to hyperspectral imagery
* importance of spectral, spatial, and temporal resolution for vegetation monitoring
* in situ and laboratory measurements with a spectroradiometer
* upscaling spectroscopic measurements (from in situ to RPAS/airborne and satellite)
* processing of image and laboratory spectroscopic datasets in case studies over the arctic-alpine tundra in the Krkonoše Mts. and the Norway Spruce forest in the Ore Mts., Czechia
