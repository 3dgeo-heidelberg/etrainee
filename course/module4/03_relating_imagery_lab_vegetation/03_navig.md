# In-situ and laboratory spectroscopy of vegetation

In-situ and laboratory spectroscopy provide point-based measurements of reflectance of selected
samples using portable or laboratory spectroradiometers. This theme is devoted to spectral
properties of vegetation, their relation to selected biochemical parameters such as leaf pigments and
water content, and their changes due to stress caused, e.g., by drought or pollution. Methods of
vegetation spectral properties measurement using spectroradiometers and airborne hyperspectral
sensors are explained. The theme is divided into three theoretical lessons, concluded with a quiz and a
list of literature:

* [Optical parameters of foliage â€“ leaf level](03_01_optical_parameters_of_foliage.md)
* [Principles of laboratory spectroscopy](03_02_principles_of_laboratory_spectroscopy.md)
* [Relating imaging spectroscopy and in-situ or laboratory measurements of vegetation properties](03_03_relating_imagery_lab_vegetation.md)

A practical [exercise](03_spectra_probe_sphere_exercise.md) is devoted to the comparison of spectra measured by an integrating sphere and a
contact probe. An additional [tutorial](03_spectra_image_insitu_tutorial.md) points to the issue of relating spectra obtained from imaging
and in-situ spectroscopy.
