# Comparison of spectra measured by integrating sphere and contact probe

The aim of this exercise is to visualize and compare reflectance spectra acquired by a contact probe (CP) and an integrating sphere (IS) attached to the spectroradiometer ASD FieldSpec 4 Hi-Res. 
The spectra were collected for homogenous material represented by green colored paper and natural material represented by a green leaf. 

- *Prerequisites*
    - Installed spreadsheet editor (MS Office Excel, LibreOffice Calc or other) or R      
    - Downloaded data ([module4/theme3_exercise_spectra_comparision](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10003574)); based on your preferred working environment, use either the file```Exercise_M4_T3_data.xlsx``` (excel spreadsheet) or ```Exercise_M4_T3_data_CP.txt``` and ```Exercise_M4_T3_data_IS.txt``` (text file)  
    The dataset consists of:
        + wavelength (column ```Wavelength```)
        + three spectra measured by contact probe (CP) at three different places of the sample (column ```paper_CP_XXXXX```, ```leaf_CP_XXXXX```)
        + one spectrum measured by integrating sphere (IS) (column ```IS_green_paper```, ```IS_green_leaf```).
         
- *Tasks*
    - Data visualization
    - Compare the reflectance spectra from the integrating sphere and contact probe 


## 1. Data visualization  
Prepare graphs displaying all of the reflectance spectra acquired by the contact probe. Do measurements of spectral variability on leaf and paper differ in any way? And if yes, then why? Calculate the median spectra for both materials.


## 2. Comparision of reflectance spectra  
Compare the reflectance spectra acquired by the integrating sphere with the computed median spectra from the contact probe (for both materials). What variations can you find between the spectra?
