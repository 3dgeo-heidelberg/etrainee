# Principles of imaging and laboratory spectroscopy

Imaging and laboratory spectroscopy is a dynamic discipline that allows monitoring the properties of the Earth's surface (and the surfaces of other bodies in the Solar System) in high detail. It has a wide range of applications e.g., in geology and paedology (e.g., rock and soil composition), plant biology and ecology (e.g., physiological status and stress of vegetation), hydrology, or waste management.

## Objectives

In this theme, you will learn about 
* fundamentals of imaging and laboratory spectroscopy,
* hyperspectral (HS) cameras and spectroradiometers,
* interpretation of a hyperspectral data cube,
* spectral libraries,
* examples of imaging and laboratory spectroscopy applications in environmental monitoring.

The theme ends with a **[self-evaluation quiz](#self-evaluation-quiz)**, an **[exercise](#exercise)**, and a list of **[references](#references)**.

In the practical exercise you will explore spectra of selected land cover classes collected with an RPAS hyperspectral camera in the EnMapBox software.

After finishing this theme, you will be able to assess advantages and drawbacks of using hyperspectral imaging in comparison to multispectral observations and how field and laboratory spectroscopy supports the aerial/RPAS campaigns.

The content of the lesson is curently available as a pdf file.


## Self-evaluation quiz


## Exercise


### Exploration of hyperspectral data using EnMAP-Box

The aim of this exercise is to get acquainted with data in the EnMAP-Box environment, to understand the possibilities
of visualization, the concept of hyperspectral data, and to compare spectral properties of selected vegetation classes.

Please proceed to the exercise: [Exploration of hyperspectral data using EnMAP-Box](01_spectroscopy_principles_exercise.md).

### Next unit

Proceed with [Airborne hyperspectral data acquisition and pre-processing](../02_aerial_acquisition_preprocessing/02_aerial_acquisition_preprocessing.md)
