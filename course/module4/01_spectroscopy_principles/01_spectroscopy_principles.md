# Principles of imaging and laboratory spectroscopy

**UNDER CONSTRUCTION. COMING SOON.**

## Prerequisites


## Objectives


## Spectroscopy fundamentals

Spectroscopy is the study of the interaction between matter and electromagnetic radiation
as a function of the wavelength or frequency of the radiation… analysis of measured
reflected, transmitted or absorbed light as a function of wavelength.



### Spectral signature

Spectral signature is the variation of reflectance or emittance of a material with respect
to wavelengths (i.e., reflectance/emittance as a function of wavelength).




## Hyperspectral imaging

Hyperspectral imaging, like other spectral imaging, collects and processes information
from across the electromagnetic spectrum. While the human eye sees colors of visible light,
hyperspectral imaging divides the spectrum intu many bands with fine wavelength resolution
and cover a wide range of wavelengths. Hyperspectral imaging also measures continuous
spectral bands, as opposed to multiband imaging which measures spaced spectral bands.

## Exercise


### Exploration of hyperspectral data using EnMAP-Box

The aim of this exercise is to get acquainted with data in the EnMAP-Box environment, to understand the possibilities
of visualization, the concept of hyperspectral data, and to compare spectral properties of selected vegetation classes.

Please proceed to the exercise: [Exploration of hyperspectral data using EnMAP-Box](01_spectroscopy_principles_exercise.md).

### Next unit

Proceed with [Aerial/RPAS hyperspectral data acquisition and pre-processing](../02_aerial_acquisition_preprocessing/02_aerial_acquisition_preprocessing.md)
