# Temporal vs. spatial and spectral resolution

**UNDER CONSTRUCTION. COMING SOON.**


## Objectives

In this theme, you will learn about:

* Examples with practical exercises from the Krkonose tundra showing classification results of the same vegetation species from imagery with different spatial, spectral and temporal resolution.
