# Temporal vs. spatial and spectral resolution

**UNDER CONSTRUCTION. COMING SOON.**


## Objectives

In this theme, you will learn about:

* Examples with practical exercises from the Krkonose tundra showing classification results of the same vegetation species from imagery with different spatial, spectral and temporal resolution.


## Methods



## Examples 



## Exercise 



### Next unit
Proceed with a case study on [seasonal spectral separability of selected grass species of the Krkono≈°e Mts. tundra ecosystem](../08_spectral_separability_grass/08_spectral_separability_grass.md)
