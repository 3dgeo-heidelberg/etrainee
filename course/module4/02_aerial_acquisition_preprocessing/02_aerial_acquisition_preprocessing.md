# Airborne hyperspectral data acquisition and pre-processing

**UNDER CONSTRUCTION**

Acquisition of airborne hyperspectral images requires careful flight planning supported by field campaigns. 
The following preprocessing of data comprises necessary radiometric and geometric correction. In addition, spectra transformations and filtering can be carried out to reduce data volume and suppress the noise present in the data.

## Objectives

In this theme, you will learn about:

* flight planning and in-situ measurements for radiometric and geometric correction of images,
* methods of radiometric correction of HS images,
* geometric correction, including orthorectification,
* selected spectra transformations (e.g., minimum noise fraction, continuum removal, spectral indices) and spectra smoothening and denoising.

In the practical exercise, you will carry out geometric corrections of images acquired with a Nano-Hyperspec® camera mounted on the DJI Matrice 600 Pro drone platform.

After finishing this theme, you will be aware of flight parameter settings and in-situ measurements to be considered for a successful hyperspectral flight mission. 
You will understand the principles of radiometric and geometric corrections, and you will know methods for removing noise from the data and lowering the data volume.

## Methods



## Examples 


## Exercise 


### Geometric correction

The aim of this exercise is to perform geometric correction of hyperspectral image data acquired with an UAV pushbroom scanner.  

Please proceed to the exercise: [Geometric correction](02_aerial_acquisition_preprocessing_exercise_geometric.md).

### Spectra smoothening and denoising 

Please proceed to the tutorial: [Spectra smoothening and denoising](filtering_spectral_curve.ipynb).

### Next unit
Proceed with [In situ and laboratory spectroscopy of vegetation](../03_relating_imagery_lab_vegetation/03_01_optical_parameters_of_foliage.md)
