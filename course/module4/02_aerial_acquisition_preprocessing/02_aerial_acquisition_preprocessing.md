# Aerial/RPAS hyperspectral data acquisition and pre-processing

**UNDER CONSTRUCTION. COMING SOON.**

## Objectives

In this theme, you will learn about:

* RPAS/airplane data acquisition â€“ flight plan, scene illumination, exposure, advantages/disadvantages of RPAS/airplane platforms
* geometric correction/orthorectification of images acquired with airborne push-broom sensors
* radiometric calibrations including BRDF, filtering of a spectral curve, continuum removal, MNF, and PCA
* validation of geometric and radiometric corrections
* in situ and laboratory measurements with a field spectroradiometer
* differences between field spectroradiometer and airborne spectral measurements

After finishing this theme you will be able to:

* Visualise spectral information
* Compare spectra


## Methods



## Examples 


## Exercise 


### Geometric correction

The aim of this exercise is to perform geometric correction of hyperspectral image data acquired by an UAV pushbroom scanner.  

Please proceed to the exercise: [Geometric correction](02_aerial_acquisition_preprocessing_exercise_geometric.md).

### Radiometric calibration

Comparison of data with different level of radiometric calibration ([QGIS](../../software/software_qgis.md) + [EnMAP Box](../../software/software_enmap_box.md)),

Please proceed to the exercise: [LINK WILL BE ADDED]().

### Spectral transformation

Performing spectral transformations (PCA, MNF, continuum removal) in [R](../../software/software_r_language.md).

Please proceed to the exercise: [LINK WILL BE ADDED]().

### Next unit
Proceed with [In situ and laboratory spectroscopy of vegetation](../03_relating_imagery_lab_vegetation/03_01_optical_parameters_of_foliage.md)
