## Report 

**UNDER CONSTRUCTION. COMING SOON**

##### Data preparation, relative and absolute accuracy

##### Image registration

##### Accuracy assessment

##### Q&A 

* Evaluate the absolute and relative accuracy after geometric correction. What is the maximum error? Is the resulting accuracy sufficient?  
    + 
* Compare the “raw” image strips with the geometrically corrected (orthorectified) image strips in terms of computed accuracy and visual inspection.  
    + 
* Are there any differences between the results of the spline and polynomial transformations?  
    + 
* Comment on the used resampling method: what does “Nearest neighbour” ensure? Would using a different resampling type affect the image, and if yes, then how?
